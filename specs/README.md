## ðŸ“Š Status

**Progress:** 100% Complete (6/6 tasks)

**Key Achievements:**

- âœ… TypeScript type checking works across all packages from root
- âœ… Shared configs for different contexts (frontend vs backend)
- âœ… Docker builds are deterministic (10/10 tests passing)
- âœ… External projects can link via `pnpm link`
- âœ… Turbopack configuration validated for symlinked packages
- âœ… All patterns documented and ready for reuse
